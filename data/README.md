# Doc2Vec fork version 

Doc2Vec fork version (https://github.com/jhlau/gensim) was needed in order to build a document vector for each tweet starting from a pre-trained word vector. So Glove vocab results could be provided to the doc2vec model and also Standord word vectors.

The steps to use this fork version are:

 * Clone or Download the git folder
 * Use the pip setup.py install command from the terminal in the proper git folder (previuosly cloned or downloaded)
 * Import the library with the following : import gensim.models as g (to distinguish it from gensin of https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)
